# Group Extension API

The group extension API makes it very easy to add custom creation steps, edit screens, navigation items and pages to a group. It essentially allows you to create fully functional extensions to BuddyPress created groups.

The Group Extension API consists of a base class called `BP_Group_Extension`, which you extend in your own add-on. `BP_Group_Extension` does most of the work necessary to integrate your content into BP group â€“ creating new navigation tabs, registering a step during group creation, etc.

**NB**: the group extension requires the Groups component to be active. Please make sure to wrap your extended class in a `if ( bp_is_active( 'groups' ) ) :` check.

## Building a custom BuddyPress Group Extension

Located inside the `/bp-groups/classes` directory, the `BP_Group_Extension` class will help you to organize your custom group extension. BuddyPress group extensions are registered into the `$group_extensions` property of the `buddypress()->groups` global using the name of your custom class. This registration step needs to be hooked to the `bp_init` action at a priority lower than `11` (you can omit the hook `$priority` argument to use the default one - `10`) and is done passing the name of your class to the `bp_register_group_extension()` function. Below is an example of how you can register your group extension in BuddyPress.

```php
/**
 * Registers the custom group extension.
 */
function bp_custom_add_on_register_group_extension() {
	bp_register_group_extension( 'BP_Custom_AddOn_Group_Extension' );
}
add_action( 'bp_init', 'bp_custom_add_on_register_group_extension' );
```
