## Additional Reference: The accepted conventions on asking questions

It can be worthwhile reading through this document below as a primer on what is suggested as the correct approach to asking questions on forums and lists. While it’s aimed at the poster as guidance on how to behave and form a question that will gain positive responses, it’s useful for all to understand and is considered as a RFC: [How To Ask Questions The Smart Way](http://www.catb.org/esr/faqs/smart-questions.html).
