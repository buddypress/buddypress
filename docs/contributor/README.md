# Contributor Handbook

Welcome to the BuddyPress Contributor Handbook. As an [open source project](./project/README.md), BuddyPress can accept changes from anybody in the world. If your goal is to learn faster collaborating with others or simply improve the software you use to power your WordPress site's community area, this is a good place to find some guidance to help you make your first contributions. Contributing to BuddyPress can be as simple as [fixing typos](./code/README.md) or updating [documentation](./documentation/README.md).

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Our software is maintained by volunteers just like you. It is vital for the current and future success of BuddyPress to have a healthy group of contributors. Please consider being one of them!

## Contribute to documentation

Help improve BuddyPress documentation by writing some new helping resources or updating existing material on the [BuddyPress Documentation Handbooks](./documentation/README.md). Our documentation is volunteer-led and is driven by community contributions, we encourage everyone to get involved and help improve how we all can enjoy BuddyPress.

## Support Forums

The most valuable way to contribute to BuddyPress is to help others learning how to use the software, on our [support forums](https://buddypress.org/support/).

## Test & Report Bugs

Testing BuddyPress [beta](https://buddypress.org/tag/beta/) releases for issues is critical to developing the software and ensuring its quality. It is the key to a safe upgrade for you and every BuddyPress users. It’s also a meaningful way for anyone to contribute — whether you have coding experience or not. If you think you’ve found a bug, it’s a good idea to search Trac first to see if a ticket already exists that you could contribute to. Otherwise, go ahead and open a [new ticket](https://buddypress.trac.wordpress.org/newticket)!

Never written a bug report? The [WordPress Core Contributor Handbook](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/) has an excellent guide on what to do [before you report a bug and how to write a good bug report](https://make.wordpress.org/core/handbook/testing/reporting-bugs/#before-you-report-a-bug).

## Translate BuddyPress

Become a [Translation Contributor](https://make.wordpress.org/polyglots/handbook/translating/glotpress-translate-wordpress-org/) translating BuddyPress into your language or improving existing translated texts. Choose your preferred language e.g. [French](https://translate.wordpress.org/locale/fr/default/wp-plugins/buddypress/). Then select ‘[Stable (latest release)](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/buddypress/stable/fr/default/)’ or ‘[Development (trunk)](https://translate.wordpress.org/projects/wp-plugins/buddypress/dev/fr/default/)’ and start submitting your contributions.

## Contribute with Code

You are very welcome to join us to work on making the plugin as great as possible : every enhancement and each improvement depends on the community. This [Quick Start Guide](./code/README.md) to contributing code to BuddyPress Core is where you can find the resources needed to take you through the process of submitting your [first patch](https://github.com/buddypress/buddypress/blob/master/docs/contributor/code/README.md#patching-buddypress) or your [first pull request](https://github.com/buddypress/buddypress/blob/master/docs/contributor/code/README.md#including-your-fix-into-a-pull-request).
