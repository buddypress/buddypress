# BuddyPress xProfile fields administration

Highlight the best of your community members by creating an unlimited number of Extended Profile (xProfile) Fields and/or groups of Extended Profile Fields custom-made for your community site.

To start creating xProfile fields, go to administration menu Users > Profile Fields. If you have a multisite installation with BuddyPress activated network-wide via Network Admin > Plugins, youâ€™ll find the Profile Fields admin screen via Network Admin > Users > Profile Fields.

The BuddyPress xProfile component comes with 2 default groups of profile fields:
- the "Base" profile fields group
- the "Signup Fields" group (fields attached to this group are only displayed on the registration page of your site).

> [!NOTE]
> **NB**: As shown above, groups of profile fields are listed using tabs just over the list of profile fields they are including.

It also adds a primary profile field (to store the display "Name" of your members) inside these two groups.

## Adding a new field to a profile fields group

Activate the group's tab you want to add your profile field into and then click on the "Add new field" button to reach the below xprofile field form:
